# Active-Directory-Project
This project involves building and securing an Active Directory environment by setting up virtual machines, configuring Sysmon and Splunk for monitoring, and installing Active Directory. It also includes testing security with brute force attacks from Kali Linux, viewing telemetry in Splunk, and running atomic tests with ART.
